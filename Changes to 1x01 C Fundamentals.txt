 If #define DEBUG is in header file, the code works as expected.
  If #define DEBUG is in the .c file where #ifdef code is, it won't work.
  Don't know why this should be the case.
 Using '%u' instead of '%d' for size_t variables in printf function calls.
 Using casting from size_t to signed int for strlen.
  No risk of strlen returning value greater than 2^31.
 Still can't get #ifdef DEBUG to work in single .c file w/o using header file.
  It makes no sense so using #ifdef DEBUG_400 where DEBUG_400 is specific to a .c file.
  And oddly, in using it, I'm not finding it helpful.
 Major flaw in StringCompare function. 'fdsa' before 'asdf'
  because 'a' comes before 'f'. Not what is required.
  Changing algorithm and it seems to be working.
  This bug was likely the cause of problems with single-linked list of chars.
 Complete unit testing of single-linked list of ints and coding this data structure.
  It's working as expected.

2017.01.22
 Clean up use of include files in the individual C files.
 Using size_t instead of int for return of strlen or strspn.
  size_t is unsized 64-bit int, while int is 32-bit and signed.
 Change use of &Inputs to Inputs. 
 Using scanf_s instead of scanf to avoid warnings.
  Not doing - more problems than it's worth.
 Tried using strcpy_s instead of strcpy. Works in MS,
  but can't get it to work w GCC and should. Part of C11.
 Trying to use #ifdef DEBUG but code won't execute.
  Colour of code changes from soft to normal when #define DEBUG used
  but while running the code is stilled ignored. Frustrating.

2017.01.21
 Creating and using CHOICE_LENGTH define in main header file.
 Standardize the comment header for each page.
 Using '#pragma once' in header files.
 Using #define DEBUG, #ifdef DEBUG...#endif for debugging only code.

2017.01.20
 Test and simplify function GetUserInputs.
 Putting function GetUserInputs in use in existing code.
 Using #ifndef MAIN_HEADER_FILE as precompiler directive.

2017.01.19
 Adjust TrimWhitespace code to handle string with only whitespace.
 Adding user-defined function GetUserInputs to get string.

2017.01.18
 Adding test code for linked lists to automate inputs and see results.

2017.01.17
 Remove use of strlwr() since it's not std C. Use tolower() instead.
 Move '#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS' to header file.
 Some general housekeeping on existing code.
 Adding User-defined Functions in Main Menu.
 Using these functions from other files.
 Putting 'FileExists' function in library.
 Putting 'StringCompare' function in library.
 Creating a TrimWhitespace function for use in string inputs.

2017.01.16
 Adding test code on Standard I/O - working through functions in stdio.h.
 Adding test code on using char array in self-referential structure - it's working
 Reworking the SLL code for char array. Need to malloc char value in struct.

2017.01.15
 Adding test code on Standard I/O.
 Test code on creating memory and freeing with function call. It works.
 SLL - adding code to free memory.
 Creating submenu for single-linked lists b/c going through variations.
 Code for SLL using char instead of int.

2017.01.14
 Working on single-linked list. Coding to insert a node.
  And coding to remove nodes from the list. It's working.
 Adding Standard I/O as main menu item. Coding various uses of I/O.
 Adding details about <stdio.h> on header files page.
 Frustrated by lack of guidence on what's C or C++ or MS's meddling.

2017.01.13
 Simplify code by using strlwr when testing menu item choices.
 Add '#define MAX_INPUT_CHARS 80' in main header file and use in various code files.
 Finish making addions to String Manipulations page.
 Finish adding details on <string.h>.
 Move system("pause") back from top menu to individual functions.
 Add final else to if...else to display a message if choice not found.
 Adding Data Structures as main menu item.
 Adding code for a single-linked list - still a WIP.

2017.01.12 
 Reorganizing the main menu - push down some items to sub menus.
 Include _3x07_DynamicMemoryAllocation into main menu.
 Adding details on enumerations.
 Adding details for string manipulations.
 Adding more details to header files page.
