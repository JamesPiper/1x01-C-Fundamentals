# 1x01-C-Fundamentals
Coding In C.

The focus is on programming in C by going through the keywords, functions in header files etc. to learn the language and to create a point of reference on what's working and what doesn't work.

Using Visual Studio 2015 because it's a good IDE but it's a C++ compiler, not C. To complicate matters, MS introduces coding specific to this compiler. Not best situation. Too much work to see what's C v. C++ v. MS specific. So, looking at using GCC for this project.
